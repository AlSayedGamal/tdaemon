## Test Daemon

The test daemon watches the content of files in a directory and if any of them
changes (the content is edited), it runs the tests.

### Installation

Put the tdaemon somewhere where it's executable.

You may run like this:

    $ tdaemon.py --test-program=nose /path/to/python/project

The daemon starts watching the directory and subdirectories. As soon as one file
changes, the daemon runs the nosetests and you may watch the result.

Two test programs are available:

* nosetests (keyword is `nose` or `nosetests`)
* django (keyword is `django`)

When you're using django, the path to the project must be the path where
`manage.py` lives.

### TODO

    [ ] implements py.test, if possible
    [ ] I remember I made the first bits of the code after reading an article...
        [ ] Find the link and name of the original author
        [ ] add appropriate credits
    [ ] Benchmark it with larger files
    [ ] Extend the test utilities to other languages
    [ ] Add an "ignore" option to ignore other files (logs, sqlite database,
        image files, etc)
